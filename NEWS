0.5-1 2016-11-09
  * Minor tweaks to work with newest version of ggplot2
  * No longer exporting all functions using regex but explicitly naming them now
  
0.5-0 2016-11-07
  * Power function for Omega Squared was added
  * diamondPlot functions were added
  * Pander methods for some functions were added
  * Some functions to make R more accessible for SPSS users were added (e.g. regr, oneway, examine)
  * Confidence intervals implemented in Tukey and Games-Howell posthoc tests\
  * Simple interfaces for generating ggplot scatterplots, Q-Q plots, boxplots, barcharts and pie charts were added
  * showPearsonPower, a function to show the power of a Pearson correlation was added
  * Cohen's d and Omega Squared distributions were added by converting to and from t and F
  * A function to detect rare words was added
  * Functions to automate figure and table captions in R Markdown/knitr were added
  * therapyMonitor was added, a function to aid n-of-1 analyses for therapists
  * prevalencePower was added, a function for power analyses for prevalence studies

0.4-0 2015-
  * processOpenSesameIAT was added, to process OpenSesame IAT datafiles

0.3-0 2015-04-16
  * Fixed powerHist to finally show frequencies with scaled normal curve
    and density curve
  * Fixed a bug in 'oneway'; post-hoc tests now working better
  * The 'regr' function now also computes the confidence interval for R^2
  * Renamed scaleReliability to scaleStructure and improved it to also provide
    estimates assuming an ordinal level of measurement as well as hierarchical
    omega in addition to total omega
  * Improved the way p values are reported in rMatrix
  * Improved dlvPlot to show both confidence intervals and standard errors

0.2-2 2015-04-07
  * Error in getData, that was introduced when it was changed to work better with getDat, corrected
  * Way eta^2 is computed in oneway corrected
  * A plot can now automatically be ordered when using meanDiff

0.2-1 2015-03-23
  * getDat added to automatically create a dataframe
  * Minor additions to the conversion functions
  * Added and implemented formatPvalue for cleaner p value formatting
  * Exported the case insensitive %IN%

0.2-0 2015-02-27
  * New function associationMatrix() added, which takes a list of variables
    and generates a table with confidence intervals of their effect sizes
  * New functions freq(), oneway(), and regr() added, which behave similar
    to SPSS functions to generate frequency tables, oneway anovas, and
    do simple regression analyses
  * New function samplingDistribution() added, which allows quick generation
    of sampling distributions based on frequency information
  * Added didacticPlot(), which builds plots that are useful for watching
    what happens when doing null hypothesis significance tests
  * Added dataShape() so that e1071 is no longer needed for Skewness and Kurtosis
    in normalityAssessment()
  * Added associationMatrix, which enables the creation of matrices with
    effect sizes and their confidence intervals.

0.1-2 2014-04-21
  * testRetestReliability() added to conveniently call both testRetestAlpha()
    and testRetestCES().
  * testRetestAlpha() and testRetestCES() added to compute the test-retest
    coefficient Alpha and the Coefficient of Equivalence and Stability (CES).
  * filterBy() and useAll() added for users coming from SPSS
  * convertToNumeric and massConvertToNumeric added to convert vectors to
    numeric vectors.
  * meanDiff.multi improved to generate a forest plot by default, with line at
    zero to show 'significant' deviations more clearly
  * dlvPlot improved to show better confidence intervals and take confidence level
    into account
  * getData() can now also read from .csv, .tsv, .xls, and .xlsx. If
    ROpenOffice from http://omegahat.org is installed, .ods can be read,
    too.
  * Added is.odd() and is.even() to check whether numbers (or numbers in a vector) are odd or even.

0.1.1 2014-04-17
  * Initial Release
