\title{
Confidence Interval-Based Estimation of Relevance (CIBER)
}
\description{
This function generates a high-level plot consisting of several diamond
plots. This function is useful for estimating the relative relevance of
a set of determinants of, for example, behavior. The plot in the left hand
panel shows each determinant's distribution with a diamond representing the
confidence interval. The right hand plot shows the determinants' associations
to one or more 'target' variables, such as behavior or determinants of behavior.

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data, dat}{
  The dataframe containing the variables.
}
  \item{determinants}{
  The 'determinants': the predictors (or 'covariates') of the target variables(s) (or 'criteria').
}
  \item{targets}{
  The 'targets' or 'criteria' variables: the variables predicted by the determinants.
}
  \item{determinantStructure}{
  When using \code{detStructCIBER}, the determinant structure as generated by
  \code{\link{determinantStructure}} is included here. \code{determinants},
  \code{targets}, \code{subQuestions}, \code{leftAnchors}, and
  \code{rightAnchors} are then read from the \code{\link{determinantStructure}}
  object. In other words: once a \code{\link{determinantStructure}} has been
  generated, only \code{dat} and \code{\link{determinantStructure}} have to
  be provided as argument to generate a CIBER diamond plot.
}
  \item{conf.level}{
  The confidence levels for the confidence intervals: has to be a named list with two
  elements: \code{means} and \code{associations}, specifying the desired confidence levels
  for the means and associations, respectively. The confidence level for the associations
  is also used for the intervals for the proportions of explained variance.
}
  \item{subQuestions}{
  The subquestions used to measure each determinants. This can also be
  used to provide pretty names for the variables if the determinants
  were not measured by one question each. Must have the same length as
  \code{determinants}.
}
  \item{leftAnchors}{
  The anchors to display on the left side of the left hand panel. If the
  determinants were measured with one variable each, this can be used to
  show the anchors that were used for the respective scales. Must have the
  same length as \code{determinants}.
}
  \item{rightAnchors}{
  The anchors to display on the left side of the left hand panel. If the
  determinants were measured with one variable each, this can be used to
  show the anchors that were used for the respective scales. Must have the
  same length as \code{determinants}.
}
  \item{orderBy}{
  Whether to sort the determinants. Set to \code{NULL} to not sort at all;
  specify the name or index of one of the \code{target}s to sort by the point
  estimates of the associations with that target variable. Use
  \code{decreasing} to determine whether to sort in ascending or
  descending order. For convenience, if \code{orderBy} is not
  \code{NULL}, but \code{decreasing} is, the determinants are sorted in
  descending (decreasing) order.
}
  \item{decreasing}{
  Whether to sort the determinants. Specify \code{NULL} to not sort
  at all, \code{TRUE} to sort in descending order, and \code{FALSE} to
  sort in ascending order. If \code{decreasing} is nor \code{NULL},
  but \code{orderBy} is \code{NULL}, the determinants are sorted by
  their means. For convenience, if \code{orderBy} is not
  \code{NULL}, but \code{decreasing} is, the determinants are sorted in
  descending (decreasing) order.
}
  \item{numberSubQuestions}{
  Whether or not to number the subquestions. If they are numbered, they are
  numbered from the top to the bottom.
}
  \item{generateColors}{
  The colors to use to generate the gradients for coloring the diamonds
  representing the confidence intervals. Has to be a named list with two
  elements: \code{means} and \code{associations}, specifying the desired
  colors for the means and associations, respectively.
}
  \item{strokeColors}{
  The palette to use to color the stroke of the confidence intervals for
  the associations between the determinants and the targets. Successive
  colors from this palette are used for the targets.
}
  \item{titlePrefix}{
  Text to add before the list of target names and the proportions of
  explained variance for each target. This plot title also serves as
  legend to indicate which target 'gets' which each color.
}
  \item{titleVarLabels}{
  Optionally, variable labels to use in the plot title. Has to be the
  exact same length as \code{targets}.
}
  \item{titleSuffix}{
  Text to add after the list of target names and the proportions of
  explained variance for each target.
}
  \item{fullColorRange}{
  If colors are specified, this can be used to specify which values,
  for the determinant confidence intervals in the left hand panel,
  are the minimum and maximum. This is useful if those scores are not
  actually in the data (e.g. for extremely skewed distributions). If
  \code{NULL}, the range of all individual scores on the determinants
  is used. For the associations, \code{c(-1, 1)} is always used as
  \code{fullColorRange}.
}
  \item{associationsAlpha}{
  The alpha level (transparency) of the confidence interval diamonds in the
  right hand plot. Value between 0 and 1, where 0 signifies complete
  transparency (i.e. invisibility) and 1 signifies complete 'opaqueness'.
}
  \item{returnPlotOnly}{
  Whether to return the entire object that is generated (including all
  intermediate objects) or only the plot.
}
  \item{drawPlot}{
  Whether the draw the plot, or only return it.
}
  \item{baseSize}{
  This can be used to efficiently change the size of most plot elements.
}
  \item{dotSize}{
  This is the size of the points used to show the individual data points
  in the left hand plot.
}
  \item{baseFontSize}{
  This can be used to set the font size separately from the \code{baseSize}.
}
  \item{theme}{
  This is the theme that is used for the plots.
}
  \item{xbreaks}{
  Which breaks to use on the X axis (can be useful to override
  \code{\link{ggplot}}'s defaults).
}
  \item{\dots}{
  These arguments are passed on to \code{\link{biAxisDiamondPlot}} (for
  the left panel) and \code{\link{diamondPlot}} (for the right panel).
  Note that all argument are passed to both those functions.
}

}
\value{
Depending on the value of \code{returnPlotOnly}, either the
plot only (a \code{\link{gtable}} object) or an object containing most
objects created along the way (in which case the plot is stored
in \code{$output$bla}).

The plot has \code{width} and \code{height} attributes which can be
used when saving the plot.
